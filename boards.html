    <p>DATA SCIENCE DEGREE OBJECTIVES:<br>1. Assess, structure, manage and implement large data sets derived from real-time sources.<br>
        2. Compile data from multiple sources, including data selection, data scrubbing and feature engineering, with an emphasis
        on tidy data and the tidyverse.<br>
        3. Apply statistical tests and tools appropriately to analyze data sets drawn from different types of sources (nature,
        humankind, organizations, etc.), making inferences and projections from the data.<br>
        4. Create visualizations of large data sets in ways that clarify understanding of their meaning and implications.<br>
        5. Design and implement big data, artificial intelligence and statistical and visual analysis solutions that provide people and
        organizations with understanding, guidance and options drawn from the data.<br>
        6. Demonstrate best practices regarding digital privacy and the ethical use of personal information.</p>
